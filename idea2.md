The second idea I want to build a game called "Shoot the balloons".
I will build a background with grass and sky.
The balloons ðŸŽˆ will float from bottom to top with random color and random locations. 
Multiple balloons will appear at the almost same time.
Balloons movement speed from slow to faster.
The player uses the mouse to click the balloons.
If player miss three balloons, then game over.
