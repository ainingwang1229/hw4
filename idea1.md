My first idea is "Fish eat balls". I will build a background with deep ocean image. And a fish will show up in the screen.
Then player use mouse or left and right on the keyboard to move the fish.
The random location ball with random color but same size will show up with same time together.
Player move fish touch the ball will be got 1 point for each ball.
The ball only wait for 5 seconds if player doesnâ€™t touch it. And lost one life bar point. Total 3 life bar points.
If player lost all 3 life bar points. Then game over.
